\section{Project  Management Approach}
This project was completed in 2 one-week sprints, managed on Trello.\newline\newline
Source control was done through GitHub.\newline\newline
Sprint 1 consisted of establishing our source control repository and implementing the functions necessary prior to actual test execution. This included directory traversal to find .tst files, compiling the source code, and creating the log file. \newline\newline
Sprint 2 consisted of combination of these functions and execution of tests.

\section{Phase  Overview}

\subsection{Design}
The design phase consisted of determining specifications from the client, Dr. Logar. With the specifications determined, we devised a flowchart.

\subsection{Implementation}
The implementation phase was to write the code to fit the specifications of the program.\newline
This phase was split over two sprints, as described in section 2.2 above.

\subsection{Testing}
After the code was written, it was tested to ensure proper functionality.
