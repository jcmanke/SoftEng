\chapter{Mission}

To create a program capable of automatically grading programs written for lower-level programming courses such as CSC150 and CSC250. Given the name of a source code file, it will compile the code and find all test cases (notated by a ".tst" extension) in the parent and any child directories of where this program's executable is located. The target program will be run against each test case and be recorded as a pass or fail based on the difference between expected and actual output. After all the tests are executed, the results, including statistics, will be written to a log file.
