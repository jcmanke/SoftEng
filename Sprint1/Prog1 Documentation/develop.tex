\chapter{Development Environment}

This section describes to any user how to set up a development environment for modification and extension of existing code.  This information can also be used for developing a "release" version of Lounge Against The Machine's code with which to execute tests.

\section{Development IDE and Tools}
Any current Linux distrobution with a gcc compiler atleast at version three should build and run the program. Editing the program can be done with a text editor such as Gedit, VIM, or Emacs.

\section{Source  Control}
Source control was done through GitHub both on windows and linux environments while leveraging git for the actual control mechanism.  SVN is also supported through GitHub, however for ease and understaning of previous tools, git was sellected.

\section {Dependencies}
There are no specific dependencies with this development system aside from the development environment, namely a Linux with gcc version three or higher.

\section{Build  Environment}
Program is compiled using a makefile, but can be compiled using "g++ -o grade grade.C".

\section {Development Machine Setup}
All members of Lounge Against The Machine leveraged their own computational systems from raspberry pi's to workstations to verify cross architecture compatability.  No further setup was made.
