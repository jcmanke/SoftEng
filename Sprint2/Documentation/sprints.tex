\section{Sprint Report \#1}

This sprint lasted from 2/4/14 from 2/19/14. The members of the Whitespace Cowboys setup Github 
accounts as well as repositories on both personal Linux and Windows machines. Two offical scrum 
meetings were held, the first of which was to set up Github and the second of which was to assign 
different members to the writing of sections of documentation and hold a code review. 

The coding section of the project was officially done on 2/14/14, when the code review was held. 
The team members made sure the coding and the coding standard were up to requirements, as well as
checked the state of the current documentation in the .cpp file. 

\section{Sprint Report \#2}

This particular sprint lasted from 2/21/14 to 3/23/14.  The members of Lounge Against The Machine reworked existing code to facilitate multiple programs of execution and a new generator system for test and answer file manufacture.  The coding started shortly after the beginning of the sprint, but was delayed over spring break for a vacation of the Tech Lead.  The project was finished and submitted on 3/23/14 where this document was updated with all relevant changes.  All make and execution variables were checked before submission.
