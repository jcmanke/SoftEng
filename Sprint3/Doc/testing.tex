\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

There was no strict testing format for this project.

\section{Overview}
Each programmer tested their code before pushing it up to the git repository.  After compatible parts were
pushed up, they were combined and tested, to ensure they worked correctly together.

\section{Dependencies}
All of the tests depend on the g++ compiler, and linux platform.  The code needs
to compile a C++ file inorder to run and test that file.


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
The test cases were provided by Dr. Logar.  These test cases were used to test the program.
Then after we were satisfied with the programs performance on the test case, the file of the test cases
was changed to ensure it still ran, more or less, the same, differences in the order the test cases were found
being unimportant.  Several different test sets were used to test the program.
