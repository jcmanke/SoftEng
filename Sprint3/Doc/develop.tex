\chapter{Development Environment}
This section will provide all the neccessary information to run, test and develop 
our source code.


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
The code was written in simple text editors, and requires no special IDE's or tools.  All
the code was tested on a Linux machine using the g++ compiler.  The debug tool
gdb was used to debug the code when necessary. Debug flag is included not in makefile.

\section{Source  Control}
We used github for source control.  The repository can be found at this url, with Sprint3
as the current version: 

https://github.com/jcmanke/SoftEng.git

\section{Dependencies}
This program is dependent on the C++ Standard Library as well as the g++ compiler
on a Linux system. gcov and gprof should have at least vanilla installs as well.

\section{Build  Environment}
The execuatble is built by the g++ compiler.  You can either compile it manually, using the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
g++ -o tester ProgramTester.cpp
\end{lstlisting}
Or by using the provided makefile.

\section{Development Machine Setup}
For the Development Machine set up any Linux machine with the GNU compiler should work, as long
as the above features are installed.
