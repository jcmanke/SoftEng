\chapter{Development Environment}
This section will provide all the neccessary information to run, test and develop 
our source code.


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
The code was written in simple text editors, and requires no special IDE's or tools.  All
the code was tested on a Linux machine using the g++ compiler.  The debug tool
gdb was used to debug the code when necessary.

\section{Source  Control}
We used github for source control.  The repository can be found at this url: 

https://github.com/TheSoftwareEngineeringAdventureLine/ProgramTesterStage2.git

\section{Dependencies}
This program is dependent on the C++ Standard Library as well as the g++ compiler
on a Linux system.

\section{Build  Environment}
The execuatble is built by the g++ compiler.  You can either compile it manually, using the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
g++ -o tester ProgramTester.cpp
\end{lstlisting}
Or by using the following make file:

\begin{lstlisting}
# compiler
CC = g++

# compiler options
CFLAGS = -c -Wall

all: tester

tester: tester.o
	$(CC) -lm tester.o -o ProgramTester

tester.o: ProgramTester.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) ProgramTester.cpp

clean:
	rm -rf *o tester
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Development Machine Setup}
For the Development Machine set up any Linux machine with the GNU compiler should work.
